	<h3>Things to do</h3>
	<p>Declared one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites for its undisputed beauty and the uniqueness of its natural landscape, the Amalfi Coast is the land characterised by the oxymoronic combination between mountain and sea, the farmer and the fisherman. The mountain, that thanks to the intense work of man, has been adapted to the demands of life over the ages. It plunges steeply into a sea, creating charming coves, deep fjords, cliffs, caverns, bays, natural arches and small pebble beaches; natural elements that have created, over the centuries, an enchanting, sinuous and seductive landscape: it is certainly not a coincidence that this area is known as the land of the Sirens, in the Homer's epic poem "Odysseus". Typical houses, painted in warm pastel colors, follow the natural slope of the foothills of Mounts Lattari, leaning against each other, creating a very picturesque landscape. From the characteristic terraces, built with dry stone walls, expands the intense scents of the lemon groves, the vineyards, the broom, the bright colors of bougainvillea which, combined with the smell of salt air, creates a unique sensory experience.</p>

- Cetara, a small fishing village, that has become famous over the years for its fishing related products, creating culinary specialties appreciated world-wide, such as the salted anchovy sauce and red tuna, for example; 
- Maiori, the ancient Reghinna Major, which, despite the wide promenade and appearance of the new town, hides a very charming old town, made up of narrow streets and alleys, dominated by the imposing castle of San Nicola de Thoro Plano, to the north, and the Collegiate Church of Santa Maria a Mare, to the west; 
- Tramonti, a group of villages and districts set among the green mountains, covered with vineyards, away from the clamor of the other coastal countries, well known for its authentic flavors, the excellent wines and dairy products;
